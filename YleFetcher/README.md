A Unity3d game engine based project, C#. It was a programming task.

Point was to use Yle's API and display a dynamic list of programs inside of a scrollable element in Unity.

Use YleFetcher.exe for a demo. 

You actually need to download YleFetcher_Data and Mono folders, as well as UnityPlayer.dll along with the .exe

- Search by program name is supported.
- If a user reaches the bottom of the list, additional items will be loaded automatically.

Yle's API is available here: https://developer.yle.fi/index.en.html
