This is a really old interview task which I've solved for a company right in the beginning of my employment history.
Basically, this was my level of coding when I had 0 years of experience.

# Mini-chat on Javascript

This project was my test task on Javascript / PHP / HTML / CSS knowledge, which I actually passed.

The task was: make a cross-browser chat, using Javascript + PHP + HTML + CSS as primary languages and Flat file database as your database (which means, a text file).

- script.js takes care of the chat's functions
- writer.php is the back-end part of the project
- database.txt and users.txt : messages database and active users database

There might be some issues with compatibility on very old browsers and it is not very stable. If only I had choice to use more modern technologies, of course, I would have done so.
