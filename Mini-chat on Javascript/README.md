This is a really old interview task which I've solved for a company right in the beginning of my employment history.

Basically, this was my level of coding when I had 0 years of experience. 

But I still like to keep it here for history.

-----------------------------------

This project was my test task on Javascript / PHP / HTML / CSS knowledge.

The task was: make a cross-browser mini-chat, using plain JavaScript + PHP + HTML + CSS as primary languages and flat file as a database.

It supports having different users, list of online users, chatting.

- script.js takes care of chat's functions
- writer.php is the back-end part of the project
- database.txt and users.txt : messages database and active users database
