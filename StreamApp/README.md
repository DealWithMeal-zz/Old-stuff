A very basic desktop streaming application (server + client). C#.

Was built as a quick attempt to do better Desktop-to-Desktop streaming than Skype does.

For demo: 

- go to Built apps
- run both client and server with Admin privileges
- specify 127.0.0.1 as target IP for server

You should see a stream now. 

Image quality is adjustable in the server app.
